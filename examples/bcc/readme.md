In this directory, we try to create a dislocation (1/2<111>) for a BCC system via inserting a new half layer and then moving atoms. b and d represent dislocations with different slopes.

The 1_2_111_dislocation.py in b and d includes the codes how to insert a new half layer, how to define a S plane, how to obtain the target S plane and how to move atoms and produce the final moved data file.
