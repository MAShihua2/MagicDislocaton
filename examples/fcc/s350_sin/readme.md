# Introduction
In this directory, we plan to create a sin line dislocation 1/2<110> on a FCC system, whose crystal direction is X ï¼š0 0 1, Y : 1 1 0, Z : -1 1 0.

To achieve this goal, we should define a S plane with only one edge in the system and other edges are not in the system. Also, the edge in the system consists of several points sampled from a sin-shape line. Here, we provide some parameters. In the next, we will introduce the meaning of each parameter.

# Yaml File
## data:
  input_file: path to data file.

  type: file type (data: the abbreviation of lammps-data ).

  data_line_item_num: the number of items for line containing atom positions in data file.

  pos_index: start index and end index of atom positions in data file.

  lattice: lattice constant.

  dxdydz: the layer distance of the direction of three coordinate axis. Tips: For dx,dy,dz the real layer distance is dx * lattice, dy * lattice, dz * lattice.


## layerization:
  direction: the direction of layerization, 0: x axis, 1: y axis, 2: z axis.

## s_plane:
  center_pos: the center position of S plane

  type: the shape of S plane, here is rect [rectangular].

  edge_range: the distances from center position to edges in the direction of X, Y, Z

  sin: means the line is a sin-shape line

    num_points: the number of points consisting the sin line.

    fix_coord: which axis of points of sin line is fixed.

    A: A in Asin(omega*x).

    omega: omega in Asin(omega*x).

    start: the index of point in the original rectangular, where the sin line start.

    end: the index of point in the original rectangular, whhere the sin line end.

## move:
  step: the burgers vector's norm

  direction: moving direction

  move_layer_range: the range of atoms should be moved. if this parameter is N and the layer of center position of S plane if a, the atoms in layers [a-N, a+N] should be moved.
