# Introduction
In this directory, we plan to create a line dislocation 1/2<110> on a FCC system, whose crystal direction is X ï¼š0 0 1, Y : 1 1 0, Z : -1 1 0.

To achieve this goal, we should define a S plane with only one edge in the system and other edges are not in the system. Here, we provide some parameters. In the next, we will introduce the meaning of each parameter.

# Yaml File
## data:
  input_file: path to data file.

  type: file type (data: the abbreviation of lammps-data ).

  data_line_item_num: the number of items for line containing atom positions in data file.

  pos_index: start index and end index of atom positions in data file.

  lattice: lattice constant.

  dxdydz: the layer distance of the direction of three coordinate axis. Tips: For dx,dy,dz the real layer distance is dx * lattice, dy * lattice, dz * lattice.


## layerization:
  direction: the direction of layerization, 0: x axis, 1: y axis, 2: z axis.

## s_plane:
  center_pos: the center position of S plane

  type: the shape of S plane, here is rect [rectangular].

  edge_range: the distances from center position to edges in the direction of X, Y, Z

## move:
  step: the burgers vector's norm

  direction: moving direction

  move_layer_range: the range of atoms should be moved. if this parameter is N and the layer of center position of S plane if a, the atoms in layers [a-N, a+N] should be moved.
